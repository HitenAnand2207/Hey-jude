            You are the kind of person who never gives up. Even under pressure, you stay
            steady and shine. You push for your goals, and your hard work shows in every
            achievement. You take care of your friends like it is second nature, and you are
            there for them, every day, even at midnight, making sure they feel heard and safe.
            That is a rare kind of strength and a very beautiful heart.
            I cannot contain all your qualities, because you are so much more than this.
            You are the sweetest soul I have ever met.
